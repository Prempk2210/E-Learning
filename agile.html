        <p>Agile SDLC model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product.</p>
        <p>Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks.</p>
        <p>Agile model believes that every project needs to be handled differently and the existing methods need to be tailored to best suit the project requirements. </p>
        <p>Each build is incremental in terms of features; the final build holds all the features required by the customer.</p>   
        <p>The Agile thought process had started early in the software development and started becoming popular with time due to its flexibility and adaptability.</p>
