        <p>Software Test automation makes use of specialized tools to control the execution of tests and compares the actual results against the expected result. Usually, regression tests, which are repetitive actions, are automated.</p>
        <p>Testing Tools not only helps us to perform regression tests but also helps us to automate data set up generation, product installation, GUI interaction, defect logging, etc. Automation tools are used for both Functional and Non-Functional testing.</p>
        <p>Automated testing is a software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production.</p>
        <p>Automated software testing uses scripted sequences executed by testing tools. Automated testing tools examine the software, report outcomes and compare results with earlier test runs. An automated test script can be created once and then used repeatedly.</p>
